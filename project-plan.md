# Symposium dApp Development Plan - Progress Update

## Overview
This document outlines the plan to develop a decentralized application (dApp) that interacts with the Symposium smart contract. The dApp will allow users to create proposals, submit opinions, vote on existing opinions, and claim rewards for winning opinions.

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed
1. Web3 infrastructure - Wallet connection and network management
2. Contract integration - ABI and service layer
3. Transaction status feedback - UI for transaction states
4. Create proposal - Blockchain integration
5. Opinion submission - Blockchain integration
6. Voting functionality - Blockchain integration

### 🚧 In Progress
1. Proposal finalization and reward claiming
2. Replacing mock data with on-chain data
3. Real-time updates with event listeners

### ⏳ Pending
1. Data caching strategies
2. Testing and optimization
3. UI/UX improvements for mobile

## Smart Contract Analysis

The Symposium smart contract provides the following key functionality:

- **Proposal Creation**: Users can create new proposals with a title, details, and expiration time
- **Opinion Creation**: Users can create opinions on proposals (either supporting or opposing) with reasoning
- **Opinion Voting**: Users can vote for existing opinions by paying a fixed amount (0.1 ETH)
- **Proposal Finalization**: After a proposal expires, it can be finalized to determine winners
- **Reward Claiming**: Users on the winning side can claim rewards based on their contribution

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript
- **Web3 Integration**: wagmi and viem
- **UI Components**: Existing UI components in the frontend directory
- **Authentication**: Wallet connection via MetaMask and other providers
- **State Management**: React Context API (integration of blockchain data with the UI)

## Current Application Structure

The application now has:

- Next.js App Router structure (`/app` directory)
- UI components in the `/components` directory
- Context API for proposal state management
- Web3 integration with wallet connection
- Blockchain service layer for contract interactions
- Transaction status feedback
- Tailwind CSS for styling

Our implementation has changed:

1. ✅ Added Web3 wallet connection
2. ✅ Implemented blockchain service layer
3. ✅ Connected forms to blockchain transactions
4. ✅ Added proper transaction feedback
5. 🚧 Working on replacing mock data with blockchain data
